# CaesarCipherEncription

**My First Cryptography Code**

**From the project in the book "*Cracking Codes With Python*"**

Explaination:

This is a program that will either "encrypt" or "decrypt" the message you enter.

This scrambling method is known as the Caesar Cipher, in which a key is given which can be interchangeable.

Changing the key is essential for providing a new encrypted method.

The key for this code does not automatically rotate, it is fixed; so only someone who can open the program to change the script will be able to change the key!
